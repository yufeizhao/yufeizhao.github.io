18.218 Probabilistic Method in Combinatorics
===============================================

**Spring 2019, MIT**

**Class meetings:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 2:30--4pm in 3-370 (note room number!)

**Lecturer:** [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com) (see website for contact info)

**Office hours:** After lectures or by email appointment. Special office hours will be set up before homework due dates

## Course description

A graduate-level introduction to the probabilistic method, a fundamental and powerful technique in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. The essence of the approach is the following: to show that some combinatorial object exists, we prove that a certain random construction works with positive probability. The course will focus on methodology as well as combinatorial applications.

**Textbook:** Alon and Spencer, [The probabilistic method](https://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Method-Discrete-Mathematics-Optimization/dp/1119061954/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), Wiley (the latest edition is 4th, but earlier editions suffice)

**Prerequisites:** Mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student. Basic knowledge of combinatorics, graph theory, and probability.

**Grading:** Entirely based on problem sets. No exams.

## Homework

[**Problem set**](ps.pdf): a list of problems for practice. A subset of these problems will be designated as to-be-turned in by midnight of each due date. You should only submit the designated problems.

| Problem set | Due date  | Problems
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:-----------|
| PS 1 | Friday Feb 22 | 4, 5, 6, 7★, 9, 12, 13(a,b★), 15, 16★
| PS 2 | Friday Mar 15 | 21, 22c, 23★, 24★, 26, 28, 30, 31★, 32★, 33★, 34★, 35, 36
| PS 3 | Friday Apr 5 | 40, 41, 43, 44★, 45, 46, 47, 48★, 49★, 52(a,b★), 53★, 54(c)★
| PS 4 | Friday Apr 26 | 55, 56, 57(a,b★), 58, 59, 60★, 61, 63(a,b★), 64★, 65, 66★
| PS 5 | Thursday May 16

You are encouraged to submit interesting problem proposals that may be suitable to be included as homework problems for the course (either your own creation or a problem you've seen somewhere else). [Please submit problem suggestions here](https://goo.gl/forms/2oqrqw0UNyz5oHeH2).



[Stellar/Gradebook](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/sp19/18.218/)

_Submissions._ All homework submissions should be typed in LaTeX and submitted as PDF on [Stellar](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/sp19/18.218/). To make the grader's job easier, please name your file `ps#_Lastname_Firstname.pdf` (replace # by problem set number, and the rest by your name). Remember to include your name at the top of your submission.

_Late policy._ Submissions are due on Stellar by **midnight of each due date**. Late submissions will be penalized by 20% per each late day. For example, for an assignment due on Friday, a submission worth _x_ points if turned in on time will be worth $0.6x$ points if submitted on Sunday.

_Sources._ At the top of each submission, you must acknowledge all sources and references consulted (other than lectures and the textbook). **Failure acknowledge sources will lead to an automatic 10% penalty**. Examples include: names of people you discussed homework with, books, and online resources. If you consulted no additional sources, you should write `sources consulted: none`.

You should not look up solutions to homework problems online (or offline). You are strongly discouraged from looking at end-of-textbook hints unless you have already thought a lot about the problem (at least an hour).

_Collaboration policy._ You are encouraged to work on the problems first on your own. It is fine to collaborate, but everyone must write their solutions individually and acknowledge their collaborators.
