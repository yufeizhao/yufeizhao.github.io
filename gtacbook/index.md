 title="The bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics">

This is the homepage for a textbook that I plan to write:

_Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics_  
_by [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com)_  

The contents will be based on the [lecture notes](../gtac/gtac.pdf) from a [course](../gtac/gtac.pdf) that I have been teaching on this subject.

The current (very tentative) plan for the table of contents:

1. Introduction: a bridge
2. Forbidding subgraphs
3. Graph regularity
4. Spectral graph theory and pseudorandomness
5. Graph limits
6. Fourier analysis
7. Roth's theorem
8. Structure of set addition
9. The sum-product problem

I will update this page with progress. 
In the meantime, you are welcome to read these [lecture notes](../gtac/gtac.pdf) (â‰ˆ version 0 of the book draft).
