Book project: Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics

 title="The bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics">

This is the homepage for a textbook that I plan to write:

_Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics_  
_by [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com)_  

The contents will be based on the [lecture notes](../gtac/gtac.pdf) from a [course](../gtac/gtac.pdf) that I have been teaching on this subject (the course also has a complete set of lecture videos).

The current (very tentative) plan for the table of contents:

0. Appetizer
1. Forbidding a subgraph
2. The graph regularity method
3. Pseudorandom graphs
4. Graph limits
5. Graph homomorphism inequalities
6. Forbidding 3-term arithmetic progressions
7. Structure of set addition
8. The sum-product problem
9. Progressions in sparse pseudorandom sets

I am currently teaching a class covering this material.
The latest public version of the book draft may be found on the [class homepage](../gtac/).
