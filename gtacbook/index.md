This is the homepage for a textbook that I plan to write:

_Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics_  
_by [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com)_  

[Latest version of the book draft](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ashj34jk6i905n/AAAhThbmPXvJcYOHS0IU2cQJa/gtacbook.pdf)
(will be updated and more chapters will be added)

[Class website](../gtac/gtac.pdf) (includes links to a complete set of lecture videos from Fall 2019).

Table of contents:

- Appetizer
- Forbidding subgraphs
- Graph regularity method
- Pseudorandom graphs
- Graph limits
- Graph homomorphism inequalities
- Forbidding 3-term arithmetic progressions
- Structure of set addition
- The sum-product problem
- Progressions in sparse pseudorandom sets
