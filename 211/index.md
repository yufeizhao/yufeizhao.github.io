## Course description

Undergraduate introduction to combinatorics. Roughly the first half of the semester will focus on enumeration, and the second half on graph theory.

**Prerequisites:** Calculus II (GIR) and linear algebra (18.06 or 18.700 or 18.701). Prior experience with abstraction and proofs is helpful

**Textbook:** Miklós Bóna, _A Walk Through Combinatorics_, 3rd or 4th edition

## Grading

3 in-class midterms worth 25% each, and homework for the remaining 25%

## Homework


All homework submissions are due at the beginning of the Tuesday lecture. Submissions may be either typed or legibly written. All steps should be justified.

_Sources._ At the top of each assignment, you must write either "**Sources consulted: none**" or a list of all sources consulted other than the course notes. Examples include: names of people you discussed homework with, books, other notes (including the ones listed in the references below), Wikipedia and other websites.

You should not look up solutions to homework problems online (or offline).

_Collaboration policy._ Reasonable collaboration is permitted. Everyone must write their solutions individually and acknowledge their collaborators.

_Late policy._ Late problem sets will not be accepted without a valid excuse such as illness
