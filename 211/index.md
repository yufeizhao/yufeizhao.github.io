## Course description

Undergraduate introduction to combinatorics. Roughly the first half of the semester will focus on enumeration, and the second half on graph theory.

**Prerequisites:** Calculus II (GIR) and linear algebra (18.06 or 18.700 or 18.701). Prior experience with abstraction and proofs is helpful

**Textbooks/references:**
* Part I: Enumeration
  * BÃ³na, _A Walk Through Combinatorics_, 3rd or 4th edition
* Part II: Graph Theory
  * [_Graph theory notes_](graph_theory_notes.pdf) by Sudakov
  * Additional textbook references:
    * West, _Introduction to Graph Theory_
    * Diestel, _Graph Theory_
    * Bondy and Murty, _Graph Theory_


## Grading

3 in-class midterms worth 25% each, and homework for the remaining 25%

## Homework


All homework submissions are due at the beginning of the Tuesday lecture. Submissions may be either typed or legibly written. All steps should be justified.

_Sources._ At the top of each assignment, you must write either "**Sources consulted: none**" or a list of all sources consulted other than the course notes. Examples include: names of people you discussed homework with, books, other notes (including the ones listed in the references below), Wikipedia and other websites.

You should not look up solutions to homework problems online (or offline).

_Collaboration policy._ Reasonable collaboration is permitted. Everyone must write their solutions individually and acknowledge their collaborators.

_Late policy._ Late problem sets will not be accepted without a valid excuse such as illness

## Midterm exams

* 80 min in-class midterms
* No notes and electronic devices (including calculators, phones, etc.) may be used

*Midterm 1* (10/11):

* [Practice exam](exam1practice.pdf) and [solutions](exam1practice_sol.pdf)
* Closed-book.
* Material covered: Lectures 9/6--9/27. Problem Sets 1 to 4. Textbook (Bona) Chapters 3--8.1.2.

*Midter 2* (11/8):

* [Practice exam](exam2practice.pdf) (solutions to appear later)
* You may bring one sheet of notes on letter-sized paper (front and back) **in your own handwriting**. Typed, printed, or photocopied notes are **forbidden**.
* Material covered: Lectures 10/2--10/30. Problem sets 5--7 (although problem set 8 is not directly covered by the midterm, it is strongly recommended to do the first four problems in problem set 8 before the midterm to get practice with techniques). Bona Chapter 8 and graph theory notes up to Theorem 3.21 (Menger's theorem). (Theorem 3.5 Mader's theorem was skipped).
* Topics covered:
  * Ordinary and exponential generating functions, with emphasis on the composition and exponential formulas
  * Basic notions of graph theory. Degrees, paths, cycles, etc.
  * Trees: properties (equivalent characterizations) and counting (Cayley's theorem)
  * Connectivity: vertex- and edge-connectivity. Whitney's theorem. Menger's theorem.
