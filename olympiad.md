# Math Olympiad training handouts

- [Handouts from Canadian IMO Training camps](https://sites.google.com/site/imocanada/)
- [Book recommendations](#book-recommendations)

I have taught classes at various math olympiad training programs. Here are some of my handouts and training material.

_If you don't know where to start, I recommend [Cyclic Quadrilaterals---The Big Picture](cyclic_quad.pdf) and [Three Lemmas in Geometry](three_geometry_lemmas.pdf)._

### Algebra

*   [Integer Polynomials](intpoly.pdf) - MOP 2007 Black group  
    Integer polynomials, including various irreducibility criteria.
*   [Inequalities](wc08/ineq.pdf) - Canadian 2008 Winter Training  
    Contains a short essay discussing the IMO 2001 inequality.
*   [Polynomials](imo2008/zhao-polynomials.pdf) - Canadian 2008 Summer Training  
    Advanced techniques in polynomials. Roots of unity, integer divisibility, intermediate value theorem, Lagrange interpolation, Chebyshev polynomials, irreducibility criteria, and Rouché's theorem.
*   [Determinants: Evaluation and Manipulation](det_eval_man.pdf) - MIT UMA Putnam Talk
*   [Linear algebra tricks for the Putnam](putnam_linear_algebra.pdf) - MIT UMA Putnam Talk

### Combinatorics

*   [Bijections](bijections.pdf)
*   [Algebraic Techniques in Combinatorics](algcomb.pdf) - MOP 2007 Black Group  
    Applications of linear algebra and posets to olympiad-style combinatorics problems.
*   [Tiling](tiling.pdf) - MOP 2007 Blue group  
    Discussion of tiling boxes with bricks. Contains many coloring and tiling problems.
*   [Counting in Two Ways](doublecounting_mop.pdf) - MOP 2007 Blue and Black group  
*   [Combinatorics: bijections, catalan numbers, counting in two ways](wc08/comb.pdf) - Canadian 2008 Winter Training
*   [Combinatorics: pigeonhole principle, coloring, binomial coefficients, bijections](comb1.pdf) - AwesomeMath 2007
*   [Combinatorics: counting in two ways, generating functions, algebraic combinatorics](comb3.pdf) - AwesomeMath 2007

### Geometry

*   [Lemmas in Euclidean Geometry](geolemmas.pdf) - Canadian 2007 Summer Training  
    A collection of commonly occuring configurations in geometry problems.  
*   [Cyclic Quadrilaterals – The Big Picture](cyclic_quad.pdf) - Canadian 2009 Winter Training  
    Explores many properties of the complete cyclic quadrilateral and its Miquel point, and also discusses several useful geometric techniques.
*   [Three Lemmas in Geometry](three_geometry_lemmas.pdf) ([Solutions](three_geometry_lemmas_sol.pdf)) - Canadian 2010 Winter Training  
*   [Power of a Point](power_of_a_point.pdf) ([Solutions](power_of_a_point_sol.pdf)) - UK Trinity Training 2011 (Mint group)
*   [Circles](imo2008/zhao-circles.pdf) - Canadian 2008 Summer Training  
    Contains a section on a particular tangent circle configuration, and another section on projective geometry, poles and polars. [Here](imo2008/zhao-prelude.pdf)'s some additional food for thought.
*   [Similarity](similarity.pdf) - Canadian 2007 Summer Training  
    Applications of similar triangles and spiral similarity.

### Number theory

*   [_a<sup>n</sup>_ ± 1](exponent_lifting.pdf) ([Solutions](exponent_lifting_sol.pdf)) - UK Trinity Training 2011  
    Working with expression of the form _a<sup>n</sup>_ ± 1 and the exponent lifting lemma.
*   [Modular arithmetic: Divisibility, Fermat, Euler, Wilson, residue classes, order](mod2.pdf) - AwesomeMath 2007
