### Lec1 9/9 --- A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics

In an unsuccessful attempt to prove Fermat’s last theorem, Schur showed that every finite coloring of the integers contains a monochromatic solution to x + y = z, an early result in Ramsey theory. Professor Zhao begins the course with a proof of Schur’s theorem via graph theory and how it led to the modern development of additive combinatorics. He then takes the class on a tour of modern highlights of the field: Roth’s theorem, Szemerédi’s theorem, and the Green–Tao theorem.

Course notes §1

### Lec2 9/11 --- Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem

Which triangle-free graph has the maximum number of edges given the number of vertices? Professor Zhao shows the class Mantel’s theorem, which says that the answer is a complete bipartite graph. He also discusses generalizations: Turán’s theorem (for cliques) and the Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem (for general subgraphs).

Course notes §2.1–2.4
 
---

### Lec3 9/15 -- Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph

What is the maximum number of edges in a graph forbidding a cycle of length four? What about forbidding a complete bipartite graph of a fixed size? Professor Zhao discusses the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem, which gives an upper bound. In the case of 4-cycles, a matching algebraic construction of a C4-free graph is also demonstrated.

Course notes §2.5–2.7

---

### Lec4 9/18 --- Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions

How does one construct graphs that do not contain complete bipartite subgraphs of a given size? Professor Zhao explains algebraic constructions known as norm graphs and more recent constructions based on the use of random polynomials. 

Course notes §2.7–2.8
 
---

### Lec5 9/23 --- Forbidding a subgraph IV: dependent random choice

Professor Zhao discusses in this lecture the dependent random choice method in probabilistic combinatorics and its application to upper bounding the number of edges in an H-free graph, where H is a sparse bipartite graph. Also discussed in this lecture are the problems of forbidding an even cycle, and forbidding a clique 1-subdivision.

### Lec6 9/25 --- Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof

Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma is a powerful tool in graph theory that gives a rough structural characterization of all large dense graphs. In this lecture, Professor Zhao explains the statement and proof of the regularity lemma.

Course notes §3.1
 
---

### Lec7 9/30 --- Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma II: triangle removal lemma

Continuing the discussion of Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma, Professor Zhao explains the triangle counting lemma, as well as the 3-step recipe (partition, clean, count) for applying the regularity method. Two applications are shown: the triangle removal lemma, and the graph theoretic proof of Roth’s theorem concerning sets without 3-term arithmetic progressions.

Course notes §3.2–3.3

---

### Lec8 10/2 --- Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma III: further applications

After proving Roth’s theorem last lecture, Professor Zhao explains Behrend’s construction of large sets of integers without 3-term arithmetic progressions, as well as another application of the triangle removal lemma to subsets of a 2-dimensional lattice without corners. 

The second half of the lecture discusses further applications of the regularity method within graph theory: graph embedding, counting, and removal lemmas, as well as a proof of the Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem on H-free graphs.

Course notes §3.4–3.5

---

### Lec9 10/7 --- Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma IV: induced removal lemma

Professor Zhao explains a strengthening of the graph regularity method that is then used to prove the induced graph removal lemma. He also discusses applications of the regularity method in computer science to graph property testing.

Course notes §3.6–3.7

### Lec10 10/9 --- Szemerédi’s graph regularity lemma V: hypergraph removal and spectral proof

In this first half of this lecture, Professor Zhao shows how to prove Szemerédi’s theorem using the hypergraph removal lemma, as well as a discussion of the hypergraph regularity method.

In the second half, he discusses a spectral graph theoretic proof of Szemerédi’s regularity lemma.

Course notes §3.8–3.9

---

### Lec11 10/16 --- Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness

Pseudorandom graphs are graphs that behave like random graphs in certain prescribed ways. In this lecture, Professor Zhao discusses a classic result of Chung, Graham, and Wilson, which shows that many definitions of quasirandom graphs are surprisingly equivalent. This result highlights the role of 4-cycles in pseudorandomness. The expander mixing lemma is also discussed near the end of the lecture.

Course notes §4.1

---

### Lec12 10/21 --- Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue

What can be inferred about a graph from its second eigenvalue? Professor Zhao explores the role of spectra in pseudorandom graphs. Some topics discussed are Payley graphs and Gauss sums, quasirandom Cayley graphs, and the Alon–Boppana bound.

Course notes §4.2–4.4

---

### Lec13 10/23 --- Sparse regularity and the Green–Tao theorem

After a brief discussion of Ramanujan graphs, Professor Zhao discusses one of his favorite topics (also the subject of his own PhD dissertation): the regularity method for sparse graphs and its application to the celebrated Green–Tao theorem that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

Course notes §4.5–4.6

---

### Lec14 10/28 --- Graph limits I: introduction

Graph limits provide a beautiful analytic framework for studying very large graphs. Professor Zhao explains what graph limits are, and their key definitions and theorems (equivalence, limit, compactness).

Course notes §5.1

---

### Lec15 10/30 --- Graph limits II: regularity and counting

Continuing the discussion of graph limits, Professor Zhao explains how graph limits can be used to generate random graphs, and also some key tools in the theory of graph limits, including the counting lemma, weak regularity lemma, and the martingale convergence theorem.

Course notes §5.2–5.4

### Lec16 11/4 --- Graph limits III: compactness and applications

Continuing the discussion of graph limits, Professor Zhao proves the compactness of the space of graphons and discusses its consequences, such as the equivalence of convergence notions for graph sequences.

Course notes §5.4–5.5

---

### Lec17 11/6 --- Graph limits IV: inequalities between subgraph densities

Among all graphs with a given edge density, which graph has the maximum/minimum triangle density? Professor Zhao explains extremal problems on subgraph densities using the framework of graph limits.

Course notes §5.6

### Lec18 11/13 --- Roth’s theorem I: Fourier analytic proof over finite field

The finite field model is a nice sandbox for methods and tools in additive combinatorics. Professor Zhao explains how to use Fourier analysis to prove the analog of Roth’s theorem in the finite field setting.

Course notes §6.1
 
---

### Lec19 11/18 --- Roth’s theorem II: Fourier analytic proof in the integers 

This lecture covers Roth’s original proof of Roth’s theorem in the integers, via a Fourier analytic density increment argument. It is recommended to first view the previous lecture where the method is first explained in the easier finite field setting.

### Lec20 11/20 --- Roth’s theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity

The first half of the lecture covers a surprising recent breakthrough that gave a short polynomial method proof of Roth’s theorem in the finite field setting, substantially improving previously known bounds on the problem.

The second half explains another proof of Roth’s theorem via the arithmetic regularity method, with consequences for popular differences.

Course notes §6.3–6.4

### Lec21 11/25 --- Structure of set addition I: introduction to Freiman’s theorem

What can we say about sets A of integers whose sumset A + A is small? Over the next several lectures, Professor Zhao discusses Freiman’s theorem, a foundational theorem in additive combinatorics, that characterizes sets with small doubling. 

This lecture begins with a discussion and statement of Freiman’s theorem, and then basic tools including Ruzsa triangle inequality and Plünnecke–Ruzsa inequality

Course notes §7.1–7.2

---

### Lec22 11/27 --- Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma

Continuing the discussion of Freiman’s theorem, Professor Zhao explains the Ruzsa covering lemma and uses it to prove Freiman’s theorem in groups of bounded exponent. He then explains Freiman homomorphisms, which are maps that partially preserve additive structure, as well as the modeling lemma. 

Course notes §7.3–7.5

---

### Lec23 12/2 --- Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov’s lemma and the geometry of numbers

Professor Zhao discusses additional tools for proving Freiman’s theorem: (1) Bogolyubov’s lemma for finding a large Bohr set in 2A−2A, whose proof uses Fourier analysis, and (2) the geometry of numbers, with an application of Minkowski’s second theorem on lattices.

Course notes §7.6–7.7

---

### Lec24 12/4 --- Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman’s theorem

This lecture concludes the proof of Freiman’s theorem on sets of small doubling. Professor Zhao also discusses additional topics related to Freiman’s theorem, including extensions to groups (abelian and nonabelian), and the polynomial Freiman–Ruzsa conjecture, which is a central open problem in additive combinatorics.

Course notes §7.8–7.11

---

### Lec25 12/9 --- Structure of set addition V: additive energy and Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers theorem

Additive energy is a measure of additive structure. Professor Zhao explains why a set with large additive energy must have a large subset of small doubling. The proof is graph theoretic and uses the dependent random choice method.

Course notes §7.12

---

### Lec26 12/11 --- Sum-product problem and incidence geometry

A famous open problem says that no set of integers can simultaneously have a small sum set A+A and a small product set AA. In the final lecture of this course, Professor Zhao explains two bounds, with the first using tools from graph theory and incidence geometry, and the second using multiplicative energy.
