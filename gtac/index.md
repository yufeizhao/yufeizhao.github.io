**Class meetings:** Mondays and Wednesdays 2:30--4pm, room 4-153

**Lecturer:** [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com) (see link for contact info)

Please include "18.225" in the subject line of your emails.

**Office hours:**
Instead of holding regular office hours, I will stay around after class to answer questions -- we may move to the common room or my office. I will also schedule ad-hoc office hours for each problem set.

My policy is to not answer by email any math questions related to the class, due to time constraints and also that emails are not a great medium for such Q&As (ask them during office hours instead). Clarification questions (about homework or lectures) should be asked in the Piazza forum (link in Canvas), as they may benefit the rest of the class.



## Course description

The course examines classical and modern developments in graph theory and additive combinatorics, with a focus on topics and themes that connect the two subjects. The course also introduces students to current research topics and open problems.

A foundational result in additive combinatorics is **Roth's theorem**, which says that every subset of {1, 2, ..., _n_} without a 3-term arithmetic progression contains _o_(_N_) elements. We will see a couple of different proofs of Roth's theorem: (1) a graph theoretic approach and (2) Roth's original Fourier analytic approach. A central idea in both approaches is the **dichotomy of structure versus pseudorandomness**, and it is one of the key themes of the course.

Roth's theorem laid the groundwork for many important later developments, e.g.,
- **Szemerédi's theorem.** Every set of integers of positive density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions;
- **Green--Tao theorem.** The primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

The course will explore these and related topics, including:

- **Extremal graph theory.** What is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on _n_ vertices? What if instead we forbid cycles of length 4? At most how many edges can an _n_-vertex graph have if every edge is contained in exactly one triangle?
- **Szemerédi's regularity lemma.** A powerful tool in combinatorics that provides an approximate description/decomposition for every large graph.
- **Pseudorandom graphs.** What does it mean for some graph to resemble a random graph?
- **Graph limits.** In what sense can a sequence of graphs, increasing in size, converge to some limit object?
- **Fourier analysis in additive combinatorics.** An important technique for studying combinatorial properties in arithmetic settings, e.g., in the proof of Roth's theorem. 
- **Freiman's theorem and the structure of sum sets.** What can one say about sets _A_ such that the sum set $$A + A = \{a + a' : a,a' \in A\}$$ is small?
- **Sum-product phenomenon.** Can a set _A_ simultaneously have both small sum set $$A + A$$ and product set $$A \cdot A$$?

Although the course will be largely divided into two parts (graph theory in the first half and additive combinatorics in the second), we will emphasize the interactions between the two topics and highlight the common themes.

_Prerequisites:_ Mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student.
Comfortable with undergraduate real analysis (18.100) and algebra (18.701/3).

_Grading:_ Primarily based on homework grades (no exams). 
A modifier up to 5 percentage points may be applied (in either direction) in calculating the final grade, at my discretion based on factors such as participation.

Cutoffs: Only non-starred problems are considered for the calculations of letter grades other than A and A+: 

* A− : ≥ 85%
* B− : ≥ 70%
* C− : ≥ 50%  
  
Grades of A and A+ are awarded at my discretion based on overall performance, in particular, solving a significant number of starred problems (please don't ask me what "a significant number" means). 
Note that for MIT students, grade modifiers do not count towards the GPA and do not appear on the external transcript.
