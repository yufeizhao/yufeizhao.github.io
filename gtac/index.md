## Course description

The course examines classical and modern developments in graph theory and additive combinatorics, with a focus on topics and themes that connect the two subjects. The course also introduces students to current research topics and open problems.

A foundational result in additive combinatorics is **Roth's theorem**, which says that every subset of {1, 2, ..., _n_} without a 3-term arithmetic progression contains _o_(_N_) elements. We will see a couple of different proofs of Roth's theorem: (1) a graph theoretic approach and (2) Roth's original Fourier analytic approach. A central idea in both approaches is the **dichotomy of structure versus pseudorandomness**, and it is one of the key themes of the course.

Roth's theorem laid the groundwork for many important later developments, e.g.,
- **Szemerédi's theorem.** Every set of integers of positive density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions;
- **Green--Tao theorem.** The primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

The course will explore these and related topics, including:

- **Extremal graph theory.** What is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on _n_ vertices? What if instead we forbid cycles of length 4? At most how many edges can an _n_-vertex graph have if every edge is contained in exactly one triangle?
- **Szemerédi's regularity lemma.** A powerful tool in combinatorics that provides an approximate description/decomposition for every large graph.
- **Pseudorandom graphs.** What does it mean for some graph to resemble a random graph?
- **Graph limits.** In what sense can a sequence of graphs, increasing in size, converge to some limit object?
- **Fourier analysis in additive combinatorics.** An important technique for studying combinatorial properties in arithmetic settings, e.g., in the proof of Roth's theorem. 
- **Freiman's theorem and the structure of sum sets.** What can one say about sets _A_ such that the sum set $A + A = \\{a + a' : a,a' \in A\\}$ is small?
- **Sum-product phenomenon.** Can a set $A$ simultaneously have both small sum set $A + A$ and product set $A \cdot A$?

Although the course will be largely divided into two parts (graph theory in the first half and additive combinatorics in the second), we will emphasize the interactions between the two topics and highlight the common themes.

**Prerequisites:** Mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student.

**Grading.** The final grade will be determined by the _minimum_ of the student's performance in the two categories:
- **Problem sets**, 4~6 problem sets
- **Writing assignments**, consisting of (1) course notes and (2) Wikipedia contributions.

There will be no exams. For borderline grades, participation may play a factor in determining the final grade. In addition, there will be a list open problems for which any significant progress/resolution may, at the discretion of the instructor, result in a grading bonus, overriding the above grading criteria.

## Course notes

[Read-only link to course notes on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gykfrmhpwbzm)

Registered students may access the write-enabled link to the course notes from the email sent to class at the beginning of term, or via the link in [Stellar](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/fa19/18.217/). 

Each student taking the class for credit is expected to write course notes on one lecture (possbily in collaboration with another student, depending on course enrollement).

Please see the beginning of the document for important information regarding this writing assignment. In particular, the students responsible for writing up a lecture should:

- By the end of the day after the lecture, produce a very rough draft that that should, at the minimum, include theorem statements and sketches of proofs discussed in lecture.
- Within four days of the lecture, complete a polished version of the notes and email the instructor to set up a 30-min appointment to go over the writing.

Everyone is encouraged and expected to contribute to editing the notes.

[Notes from the previous version of the course](fa17/gtac.pdf). They may be consulted but not copied when writing the new course notes.

## Homework

[**Problem set**](ps.pdf): a list of problems for practice. A subset of these problems will be designated as to-be-turned in by 11:59pm of each due date. You should only submit the designated problems.

| Problem set | Due date (♣ tentative) | 
|:---------------:|:-----------:|
| PS 1 | Sunday September 29 | 
| PS 2 | Sunday October 13 | 
| PS 3 | Sunday October 27 ♣ | 
| PS 4 | Sunday November 10 ♣ |
| PS 5 | Sunday November 24 ♣ |
| PS 6 | Wednesday December 11  ♣ |

[Stellar/Gradebook](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/fa19/18.217/) -- primarily used for submitting and returning homework

_Submissions._ All homework submissions should be typed in LaTeX and submitted as PDF on [Stellar](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/fa19/18.217/). To make the grader's job easier, please name your file `ps#_Lastname_Firstname.pdf` (replace # by problem set number, and the rest by your name). Remember to include your name at the top of your submission. [Suggested LaTeX template for homework submissions.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tczmqrrzbrnd)

_Late policy._ Submissions are due on Stellar by **11:59pm of each due date**. Late submissions will be penalized by 20% per each late day. For example, for an assignment due on Sunday, a submission worth _x_ points if turned in on time will be worth $0.6x$ points if submitted on Tuesday.

_Sources._ **Important!** Please acknowledge, **individually for every problem** at the beginning of each solution, a list of all collaborators and sources consulted (people, books, websites, etc.). Write `sources consulted: none` even if no sources are consulted. **Failure acknowledge sources will lead to an automatic 10% penalty**. You may not look up solutions to homework problems online or offline. 

_Collaboration policy._ You are strongly encouraged to start early and first work on the problems on your own. Reasonable collaboration is permitted, but everyone must write their solutions individually and acknowledge their collaborators.


## Wikipedia contributions

- You may work in teams of sizes 1~3 to create or revise one or more articles on Wikipedia on topics related to the course (the topic does not have be one covered in the course; anything that is tangentially related is okay)
- **Due date: Sunday December 1**. Please send the instructor an email (one per team) containing a short summary with links of your team’s contributions to Wikipedia
- This is an open-ended assignment. The goal is to create more useful “entry points” to the subject, since Wikipedia is often among the first search results when someone Googles a term.
- Quality matters more than quantity. A very rough guideline is that each person should have contributions equivalent to 30~50% of one high quality article.
- Link to page for coordination sent out in email (link also available in Stellar)

## Open problems

There will be a list of open problems related to the topic of the course in addition to those mentioned in lectures. You are encouraged to talk to Prof. Zhao if one of these problems interests you. Any major progress/resolution of one of the open problems (e.g., leading to a significant and publishable result) would be quite exciting, and could, among other things, result in an automatic A+ grade at the instructor's discretion.
