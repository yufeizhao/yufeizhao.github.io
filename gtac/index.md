## Course description

The course examines classical and modern developments in graph theory and additive combinatorics, with a focus on topics that connect the two subjects. Topics include: extremal graph theory, Szemerédi's regularity lemma and applications, pseudorandom graphs, graph limits, Roth's theorem and Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions, Gowers uniformity norms, and the Green-Tao theorem. The course also introduces students to current research topics and open problems.

Here is a taste of some of the topics discussed in the course (time-permitting).

- **Extremal graph theory.** What is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices? What if instead we forbid cycles of length 4? At most how many edges can an $n$-vertex graph have if every edge is contained in exactly one triangle?
- **Szemerédi's regularity lemma**---a powerful tool in combinatorics that provides an approximate description/decomposition for every large graph.
- **Pseudorandom graphs.** What does it mean for some graph to resemble a random graph?
- **Graph limits.** In what sense can a sequence of graphs, increasing in size, converge to some limit object?
- **Roth's theorem.** Every subset of $\\{1, 2, \dots, n\\}$ without a 3-term arithmetic progression contains $o(N)$ elements. And more generally ...
- **Szemerédi's theorem.** Every set of integers of positive density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
- **Green--Tao theorem.** The primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
- **Freiman's theorem and the structure of sum sets.** What can one say about sets $A$ such that $A + A = \\{a + a' : a,a' \in A\\}$ is not too large?
- **Sum-product phenomenon.** A set $A$ cannot simultaneously have $A + A$ and $A \cdot A = \\{a a' : a,a'\in A\\}$ both small in size.

Although the course will be largely divided into two parts (graph theory in the first half and additive combinatorics in the second), we will emphasize the interactions between the two topics and highlight the common themes.

**Prerequisites:** Mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student.

## [Course notes](https://www.overleaf.com/docs/10882601ffdwmvdgdptp/pdf.pdf)

Each student taking the class for credit is expected to write course notes on one (or more, depending on class size) lecture(s). The LaTeX files are hosted on our [Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qdwqkgfnrkwr) (registered class participants will receive a separate link by email allowing read-write access to the project).

Everyone should contribute to editing the notes.

[Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/mit/fall2017/18s997) can be used for discussions of the notes, e.g., edit requests.

More instructions are found in the "About this document" section of the notes.


## Homework


[Stellar/Gradebook](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/fa17/18.S997/)


_Submissions._ All homework submissions should be typed in LaTeX and submitted on [Stellar](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/fa17/18.S997/).

_Late policy._ Submissions are due on Stellar by midnight of each due date. Late submissions will be penalized by 20% per each late day. For example, for an assignment due on Friday, a submission worth _x_ points if turned in on time will be worth $0.6x$ points if submitted on Sunday.

_Sources._ At the top of each assignment, you **must** write either _"Sources consulted: none"_ or a list of all sources consulted other than the course notes. Examples include: names of people you discussed homework with, books, other notes (including the ones listed in the references below), Wikipedia and other websites.

You should not look up solutions to homework problems online (or offline).

_Collaboration policy._ You are allowed and encouraged to collaborate, but everyone must write their solutions individually and acknowledge their collaborators.

The problem sets, below, will be updated with new problems after each lecture, up to until about a week before the due date. It is a good idea to start early and pace yourselves accordingly.


| Problem set | Due date (♣ tentative) |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|
| [Problem set 1](ps1.pdf) | Friday Sept 29
| Problem set 2 | Friday Oct 27 ♣
| Problem set 3 | Friday Nov 17 ♣
| Problem set 4 | Tuesday Dec 12 ♣
