# Collected advice for academics

Here is my personal collection of advice writing for academics (and some specifically for mathematicians) from the internet that I have found useful. While I don't necessarily agree with everything in these articles, I found that many of them challenge the conventional wisdom in academia and forced me to re-think about my own practices and perspective.
