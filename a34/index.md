18.A34 Mathematical Problem Solving (Putnam Seminar)
====================================================

**Fall 2017, MIT**

**Meetings:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 11am--noon in 2-135

**Instructor:** [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com) (see website for contact info)

## Course description

18.A34 is a freshman advising seminar on mathematical problem solving. It is intended for students who enjoy solving challenging mathematical problems and who are interested in learning various techniques and background information useful for problem solving. Much (but not all) of the seminar will be geared toward preparing for the Putnam Competition.

**[William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition](http://math.scu.edu/putnam/):** The Putnam Competition is an annual mathematics
contest for undergraduates in the USA and Canada.  This year it will be held Saturday, December 2, 2017. **All students officially registered in the class are required to participate in the competition.** Sign up information will be available later in the term.


**Grading.** Based on homework and in-class presentations. Beyond grading for correctness, the grader may deduct points or grant bonus points based on the elegance of the solution and clarity of the writing. Class attendance is required. Too many unexcused absences is cause for concern.

MIT students who are not officially enrolled are welcome to participate, but should not hand in homework.

## Homework
You should hand in **exactly six problems** each week, at least four from the topics problem set based on the lecture.

Do not hand in supplementary problems rated strictly less than [2]; these are too easy.

Please do not hand in more than six problems, as this creates extra work for the graders. (Non-registered students should not hand in solutions)

_Late policy._ Late homework will not be accepted.

_Sources._ At the top of each assignment, you **must** write either _"Sources consulted: none"_ or a list of all sources consulted other official course material. Examples include: names of people you discussed solutions with (whether or not they are taking the class), books, Wikipedia and other websites. You should avoid looking up solutions to homework problems online (or offline); if you do, you must mention the precise source on your assignment.

_Collaborations._ You are encouraged to collaborate, but you must write up your homework independently. You should include names of your collaborators in your _sources consulted_.

_Proper write-ups._ You are expected to write your solutions at a level of detail and rigor appropriate for the Putnam Competition. Write in complete sentences. For model write-ups, see the _Additional resources_ section below.

Please ask me if you have questions about homework.

(The ordering of the topics may be subject to change. I will announce any changes at least one week in advance.)
