# 18.A34 Mathematical Problem Solving (Putnam Seminar)

**Fall 2021, MIT**

**Class meetings:** Mondays and Wednesdays 1--2pm, room 2-147

**Instructor:** [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com)

Please include "18.A34" in the subject line of your emails


## Course description and policies

This is a first-year seminar that prepares students for the Putnam Mathematical Competition, and with a focus on developing mathematical communication and presentation skills. 
This seminar is fast-paced and is targeted for students with previous experience in mathematical Olympiads, though others may benefit as well. (Units: 2-0-4)

**[William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition):** The Putnam Competition is an annual mathematics
contest for undergraduates in the USA and Canada.  This year it will be held **Saturday, December 4, 2021** (to be confirmed---check the official website for updates)

All registered students will be required to participate in the Putnam competition.

Seminar participants are selected through the First-year Advising Selection process. 
Unfortunately I cannot add additional students. (See below regarding lecture attendance)

_Class format._ (see schedule)
- **Lectures** are open to all MIT students.
- **Discussions** (i.e., non-lectures) are only open to registered class members. Most sessions will begin with a brief meta-discussion, followed by student blackboard presentations of homework solutions. Active participation is expected.

**Class attendance is required** for registered students.
Please notify me in advance if you cannot make it to class.
Too many unexcused absences is cause for concern and may lead to a non-passing grade.

_Non-registered MIT students_ are welcome to attend the lectures but not the discussion sessions and may not turn in homework.

_Grading._ Based on homework and in-class participation.
Homework will be graded on correctness and presentation. 
Illegible or extremely sloppy write-ups are unacceptable.

## Homework

Each problem set contains a (sometimes long) list of problems on a specific topic. You are encouraged to work on as many as you like, but only hand in **your six best solutions** (please do not submit more than six):

* At least 4 problems should be from the topic set
* Do not hand in supplementary problems rated strictly less than [2]; these are too easy. 
* For multi-part problems, you may decide what counts as "one solution", as long as it is reasonable (i.e., not too trivial).

_Submitting homework:_

* Homework must be submitted on Gradescope (accessible from Canvas) before the beginning of the class meeting. 
* Submission may be carefully handwritten or typed (illegible submissions are unacceptable).
* Begin each solution on a new page.
* Homework will be graded similarly to the Putnam competition. 
* Non-registered students may not hand in solutions.

_Late policy_ 
* Late submissions will not be accepted without a valid excuse.
* If you need an extension for valid excuses (e.g., unanticipated health or family issues), please email me in advance or have S3 send me a message.
* My policy is to not grant extension based on forseeable circumstances including other academic workload, extracurriculars, and poor study habits.


_Sources:_ It is required to acknowledge your sources (even if you worked independently)

* At the top of **each problem**, write a list of collaborators and sources (people, books, websites, etc.). 
* If no additional sources are consulted, you must write `Sources consulted: none` or equivalent. 
* Failure to do this will result in an automatic 1pt penalty. 
* You may NOT look up solutions to homework problems online (or offline).

_Collaborations._ 
* You are strongly encouraged to work on the problems on your own, though reasonable collaboration is permitted. 
* Everyone must write their solutions individually and acknowledge their collaborators as noted above.
* [Pset partners](https://psetpartners.mit.edu/) --- tool for finding problem set collaborators (MIT Touchstone required)
