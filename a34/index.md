18.A34 Mathematical Problem Solving (Putnam Seminar)
====================================================

**Fall 2018, MIT**

**Class meetings:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 3--4pm in 2-147

**Instructor:** [Yufei Zhao](http://yufeizhao.com) (see website for contact info)

## Course description

18.A34 is a seminar intended for students who enjoy solving challenging mathematical problems and who are interested in learning various techniques and background information useful for problem solving. Much (but not all) of the seminar will be geared toward preparing for the Putnam Competition.

**[William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition](http://math.scu.edu/putnam/):** The Putnam Competition is an annual mathematics
contest for undergraduates in the USA and Canada.  This year it will be held Saturday, December 1, 2018.
**All students officially registered in the class are required to participate in the competition.**

**Grading.** Based on homework and in-class presentations. Beyond grading for correctness, the grader may deduct points or grant bonus points based on the elegance of the solution and clarity of the writing. Class attendance is required. Please email me in advance if you cannot make it to class. Too many unexcused absences is cause for concern.

**Listeners.** MIT students who are not officially enrolled in the subject are welcome to sit in and participate, but should not hand in homework.

## Schedule and homework

Homework submissions are due at the end of class.

Each problem set (links in the schedule below) contains a (sometimes long) list of problems for you to try. You are encouraged to work on as many as you like, but only hand in **your four best solutions** (please do not submit more than four). Please type or write legibly. They will be graded similarly to the Putnam competition. (Non-registered students should not hand in solutions.)

_Sources._ At the top of each assignment, you must write either "**Sources consulted: none**" or a list of all sources consulted other official course material. Examples include: names of people you discussed solutions with (whether or not they are taking the class), books, Wikipedia and other websites. You should avoid looking up solutions to homework problems online (or offline); if you do, you must mention the precise source on your assignment.

_Collaborations._ You are encouraged to collaborate, but you must write up your homework independently. You should include names of your collaborators in your _sources consulted_.
