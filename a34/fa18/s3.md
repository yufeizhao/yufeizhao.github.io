## [Student Support Services (S<sup>3</sup>)](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3)
If you are dealing with a personal or medical issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, please discuss this with Student Support Services (S<sup>3</sup>). The deans in S<sup>3</sup> will verify your situation, and then discuss with you how to address the missed work. Students will not be excused from coursework without verification from Student Support Services. You may consult with Student Support
Services in 5-104 or at 617-253-4861. Also, S3 has walk-in hours Monday-Friday, 10-11am and 2-3pm.

## [Student Disability Services](https://studentlife.mit.edu/sds)
MIT is committed to the principle of equal access. Students who need disability accommodations are encouraged to speak with Kathleen Monagle, Associate Dean, prior to or early in the semester so that accommodation requests can be evaluated and addressed in a timely fashion. Even if you are not planning to use accommodations, it is recommended that you meet with SDS staff to familiarize yourself with the services and resources of the office. You may also consult with Student Disability Services in 5-104 or at 617-253-1674. If you have already been approved for accommodations, please contact me early in the semester so that we can work together to get your accommodation logistics in place.
