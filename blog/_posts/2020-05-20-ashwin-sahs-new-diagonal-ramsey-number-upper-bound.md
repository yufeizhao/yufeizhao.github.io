[Ashwin Sah](http://www.mit.edu/~asah/) just proved a new upper bound to diagonal Ramsey numbers. See [his preprint on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09251). This is the first improvement since Conlon's upper bound published in [Annals of Math in 2009](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607788), which in turn built on earlier work of [Thomason (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-0208(08)73063-9).

Obtaining asymptotics of [Ramsey](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/the-man-who-thought-too-fast) numbers is perhaps _the_ central open problem of Ramsey theory in combinatorics. Research on this problem had led us to a lot of new mathematics that have proven to be useful elsewhere. Most notably, [Erd≈ës' proof of a lower bound to Ramsey numbers (1947)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183510596) initiated the probabilistic method, by now an indispensable method in combinatorics.

Ashwin's improvement relies on new insights into graph quasirandomness properties.

Congratulations Ashwin! This is an impressive accomplishment.

Ashwin had just finished his undergraduate studies at MIT. I'm happy that he will be staying at MIT for his PhD. Ashwin already has an impressive [list of papers](http://www.mit.edu/~asah/research.html). I had previously mentioned Ashwin on this blog reporting on our joint work (together with Mehtaab Sawhney and David Stoner) on our work on [independent sets]({% post_url /blog/2018-05-12-the-number-of-independent-sets-in-an-irregular-graph %}) and the [reverse Sidorenko inequality]({% post_url /blog/2018-09-26-a-reverse-sidorenko-inequality %}).
