The summer is coming to an end, and the Boston air is starting to get chilly, seemingly all the sudden.
The semester is right about to start, though without the energy of all the new and returning students roaming around campus this time (most classes are online this term).
I quite miss the view from my MIT office, and all the wonderful people that I would run into the department corridors.

While in person activities grinded to a halt earlier this year, research activities has been carrying on at full speed.
I've been working from home for the past several months and connecting with my students via Zoom.
In this and the upcoming several posts, I would like to tell you about some of the things that I have been working on recently.
